                Milk is a white liquid food produced by the mammary glands of mammals. It is the
                primary source of nutrition for young mammals (including breastfed human infants)
                before they are able to digest solid food.Early-lactation milk, which is called
                colostrum, contains antibodies that strengthen the immune system.

                Semi-sweet chocolate has a cocoa solid content of 35 to 65%. One of the best ways to
                gain an understanding of this type of chocolate is to compare it to a different type
                of chocolate. Semisweet is darker than milk chocolate. In a taste comparison, it has
                a slightly bitter taste whereas milk chocolate is sweeter and more mellow.
